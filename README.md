## Whatâ€™s This All About?

Imagine a digital love jar, but instead of boring notes, you get **wild confessions**, **cheeky teases**, **romantic swoons**, and **sensual whispers**. You and your partner take turns spinning, daring, and leaving secret messages for each other. Thereâ€™s a **Love Meter** to track how hot youâ€™re getting, animated kisses flying across the screen, and a jackpot surprise thatâ€™ll make you blush. Itâ€™s playful, personal, and perfect for a flirty night in!

## For Developers (How I Built It)

- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**:
  - `tkinter`: Makes the pretty window and buttons.
  - `pygame`: Plays the kiss sound (optional).
  - `json`: Saves names and notes to `player_notes.json`.
- **Packaging**: Used `PyInstaller` to turn it into one `.exe` file.
- **Code Highlights**:
  - Canvas animations for hearts and jackpots.
  - Two-player logic with dynamic name switching.
  - Random spins with a 30% jackpot chance.

Want to tweak it? Grab the source code (`love_note_spicy.py`) and play around!

## Troubleshooting

- **No Sound?**: Make sure `kiss.wav` is in the same folder as `love_note_spicy.exe`. Download it from [freesound.org](https://freesound.org/search/?q=kiss).
- **Wonâ€™t Open?**: 
  - Windows: Check "Run anyway" option.
  - Mac/Linux: This `.exe` is Windows-onlyâ€”ask me to package it for your system!
- **Names Not Saving?**: Check if `player_notes.json` is created in the folderâ€”it stores everything.
- **Stuck?**: Tell me whatâ€™s wrongâ€”Iâ€™ll fix it fast!
